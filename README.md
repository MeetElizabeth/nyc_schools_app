# NYC ReportCard

## Conceptual Overview:
A tool created to help provide some clarity for the New York City school system in light of recent educational reforms. Users can view and compare Common Core ELA / Mathematics averages for an individual school, as well as the Progress Reports for that given school. Users can also browse testing averages for their corresponding districts and boroughs for a zoomed-out perspective.
